# Ising-model
Metropolis Ising model implementation in Julia.
The project concludes of functions to simulate and visualize Ising model. Visualization types used are:
* animations
* trajectory plots
* plots of magnetization and susceptibility functions 
Considering large amount of data and running time data should be first created and save to .txt files and then visualized.
